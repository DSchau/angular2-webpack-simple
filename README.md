# angular2-webpack-simple

A simple boilerplate, without much cruft, (heavily) inspired by [angular2-webpack][ang-2-webpack]

## Features

1. Typescript support via `awesome-typescript-loader`
1. inline CSS styles for angular 2 components via `to-source-loader` and `css-loader`
 - these styles are scoped to a component via ang2
1. HTML template imports
1. `angular-router` (3.0.0) support
