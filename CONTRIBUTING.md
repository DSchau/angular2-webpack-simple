# Contribution Guide

Contributions are **always** welcome, and I'd urge anyone who is opening an issue, to instead try and fix it themselves, and then open up a pull request.

## Making a pull request

1. Fork the repo into your own personal namespace
1. Come back to this repo and go to the Pull Requests section
1. Open a pull request, with this repo as the base, and your repo as the fork
1. Open the pull request, and I'll take a look as soon as possible!
 - Note: it'd be nice if the commits were squashed down to the minimal number of commits!
